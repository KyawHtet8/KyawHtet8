# 💫 About Me:
I am a highly motivated engineer aspiring for Junior to Mid-Level positions, bringing a solid foundation in Java/Spring Boot Backend Development coupled with two years of focused practical experience in DevOps Engineering principles, including CI/CD, Cloud Automation, and Containerization.

My experience of over one year as a Java Basic Instructor at a Java Development Class (JDC) is a testament to my firm grasp of core technical fundamentals. This role also significantly enhanced my ability to clearly articulate complex concepts and fostered strong teamwork and communication skills.

Although my studies in Computer Science (Final Year) were temporarily paused due to external circumstances, I am now proactively seeking opportunities to leverage my accumulated IT knowledge and hands-on experience in building robust, high-quality software systems and streamlining deployment pipelines through automation.

I am actively ready to contribute my dual expertise in Software Development and Deployment Automation to a challenging Junior/Mid-Level role focused on either the Spring Backend or DevOps tracks.
