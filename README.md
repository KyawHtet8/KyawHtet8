# 💫 About Me:
I'm currently looking for Java Spring backend or full-stack Junior or mid-level positions.
I'm also working as a Java basic Instructor in a Java Development Class (JDC) with over 1 year of experience. My education was paused due to COVID and the ongoing crisis in Myanmar as I was a final-year CS student. Now, I'm looking for a job to apply my knowledge and the experience I've gained in the IT field over the years.
Wish me luck, guys! xD
